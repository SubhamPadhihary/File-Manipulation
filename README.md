# File-Manipulation
movies.py is a simple script that can run movies in a folder(with specified path that you can edit inside the code) with VLC or any other local media player you have/
It's working fine now but I gotta implement a more efficient search algorithm for searching movies and maybe add a GUI where you can specify the paths in the file system
