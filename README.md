# File-Manipulation
This repo contains scripts that help me automate file management.
## 1. movies.py
movies.py is a simple script that can run movies in a folder(with specified path that you can edit inside the code) with VLC or any other local media player you have, by entering the title of the movie(Which may not be complete. Say you want to run 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', you don't need to write the whole thing, just 'Exodus' would be fine.

## 2. move_from_mega.py
A simple script to move downloaded files in mega folder to their appropriate folders.
For Example: Move an episode of a TV show to a folder D:\TV shows, and a movie to a D:\Movies.
  ### move_from_mega2.py
  Added the functionality to move comics with extensions ".cbr" or ".cbz" to the folder D:\Comics.

## 3. create_dirs_and_move.py
This script creates folders from the movie names and then moves the movies to their corresponding folders.
