# File-Manipulation
movies.py is a simple script that can run movies in a folder(with specified path that you can edit inside the code) with VLC or any other local media player you have, by entering the title of the movie(Which may not be complete. Say you want to run 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', you don't need to write the whole thing, just 'Exodus' would be fine.

It's working fine now but I gotta implement a more efficient search algorithm for searching movies and maybe add a GUI where you can specify the paths in the file system.
